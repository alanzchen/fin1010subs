00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,632
Dad like to say a few words about arbitration speculation building on electro that i gave earlier

0
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,400
On my

0
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,680
Market efficiency

0
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:13,312
And using as an example for an exchange transactions that talked about in the last lecture

0
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,384
Search for getting are term straight arbitrage

0
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,272
Is the simultaneous purchase and sale of securities with identical cash flows to yield the risks pro

0
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,880
One of these securities may be so called synthetic security

0
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,160
Made up of more

0
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:33,536
More than one underlying security and the second typically and underlying security

0
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
Speculation

0
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,352
Is the taking of risk

0
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:41,472
In order to earn an expected profit the law of one price is an economic concept

0
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,776
What is it to securities

0
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,104
For portfolio security with the same cash flows should

0
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,384
Should be priced the same

0
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,968
If it can be purchased and sold by the same agency

0
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,040
City arbitrage transaction is a very simple one

0
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:00,160
You buy the cheap security issue or borrowing sell the expensive security

0
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,952
How do you enjoy the difference

0
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,816
Because arbitrage is so incredibly profitable there are many traitors that

0
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:11,168
Devote their entire life to taking advantage of them as soon as they appear

0
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
Because of that activity arbitrage opportunities are rare and fleeting the search for arbitrage

0
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
Imposes relative price efficiency but

0
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:26,272
Tween assets considered an example of arbitrage this is the relationship

0
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
Call covered interest rate parity

0
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:33,184
Covered interest rate parity shows the arbitration post relationship between the

0
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Current exchange rate

0
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:40,352
Forward-rate which is the price of foreign exchange for delivery in the future but cold today

0
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,936
Heavy interest rates prevailing in the domestic and foreign money markets

0
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Forward-rate

0
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Is equal to the spot rate times

0
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
Oneplus the domestic interest rate

0
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,616
8 รท 1 +4

0
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
For an interest rate

0
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
1 plus the interest rate can be

0
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,504
I thought of as the return of the asset

0
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,832
And here we have the relationship based on

0
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
The direct quote if the

0
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,696
Forward-rate is greater than the spot rate

0
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
X theme

0
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
Rate of return

0
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,352
The best currency divided the rate of return in the foreign currency

0
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
Alice is your lucky day that

0
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,216
Let's take an american example from the hong kong market

0
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,056

Interest rate in hong kong dollars is 3% per annum

The synthetic forward

0
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
How do you know if borrowing in hong kong dollars

0
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,855
And investing in us dollars

0
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
Can converting a spot rate

0
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
Do you have to work very fast

0
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
Because when you sell the forward

0
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
You are he

0
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,399

You are lifting other people's ask rates

0
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,847
So you lift the price of the spot when you borrow hong kong dollars

0
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
Can large volumes you tend to push up the

0
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967

Purchasing power parity

0
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,855
Is useful but it's not useful in the arbitrage sense and it's not even very useful for

00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Speculation

0
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,951

Example for financial securities

00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,311
We seen a number of parity relationships

Covered interest rate parity

0
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
Which works through arbitrage

0
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,039
Uncovered in straight parody which works to speculation purchasing power parity which

0
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
Which works through long-term tree
