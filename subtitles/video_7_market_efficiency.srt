Will issue equity

0
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,704
Then she wants the stock price to be high

0
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
The company will receive more

0
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
More money from

0
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
When you claims that issues

0
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
But you should remember that

0
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,664
Stocks on stock exchanges

0
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,480
Are trading between investors in the

0
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
In the secondary market

0
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,880
Clarify what i mean by the secondary market

0
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,208
I'd like you to return to the managerial balance sheet

0
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
Allow me to

0
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
The

0
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
Manager of balance sheet

0
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
And so instead of having a

0
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144
Equity on the ball

0
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
Bottom of a time

0
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
I put

0
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,264
Equity on the top of the claims

0
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Parallel to

0
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,664
Now in the corporation wishes to issues equity

0
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,248
You can see that it issues new shares to the investor

0
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
For which the investor pays cash

0
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
This is called the primary market

0
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
And this differs from

0
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
The secondary market

0
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
Where investors sim

0
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Tempe sell already issued shares

0
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
To another

0
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
Let's look at real stock

0
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Price

0
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,592
The stock is general electric has the ticker symbol ge and it's listed on the new york stock

0
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,176
Exchange this is the daily stock price changes

0
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
On the 14th

0
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
Make

0
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
2008

0
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
15 and the closing price was $27.41 this is reported by

0
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
Bloomberg business

0
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,560
But you can get the same kind of information if you go to yahoo or google

0
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,656
4 morningside or other financial information providers

0
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,984
The market value of a stock is simply the

0
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
Number of shares outstanding

0
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,432
X the price of the shares we can find the number of shares outstanding here as 10

0
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,808
Is 10075.93 million shares outstanding

0
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,392
410.075 billion shares outstanding

0
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,208
We could have gotten it outstanding shares for

0
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
From the most recent financials

0
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
But if we done that we might have missed

0
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Share issuances

0
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
And repurchases that

0
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
That occurred since

0
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,752
The date of the financials if we look at the market value of ge week

0
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
I can see it

0
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
Pinpoint

0
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
07

0
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
593 bill

0
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Billion shares

0
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
X 2

0
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,552
$27.41 or 276.18 bill

0
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
Billion dollars

0
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:42,464
Now it's interesting to compare the market value of the equity of a corporation

0
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
To its book value that it's a tooth

0
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
To the value that the

0
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
Counts show

0
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
On the

0
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,656
Financial statements

0
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
Shareholders equity

0
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
Is 100

0
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
At 8

0
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
.6 billion dollars

0
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
The market

0
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,920
To book ratio is often called the price to book ratio

0
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
And that ratio

0
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,272
Parsippany 276.18

0
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
Divided by 108 points

0
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
6

0
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Orc

0
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
2.5

0
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
54 x if you go back to bloomberg you can see that they record the price to book ratio

0
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,583
They calculate the price to book ratio for you

0
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
2.54 times here

0
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
Is the price right

0
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:30,079
Where is the stock price too high or too low if the price is right to know

0
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
What would you do

0
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
Define the stock

0
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
If they were too high

0
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
What would you do if you sell it

0
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,247
I didn't have a stock in

0
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
In order to sell it

0
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
What you could do was to borrow it from somebody else

0
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,903
And sell it at the current price

0
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
Hope that the stock will then go down and

0
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
And then

0
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Biotin

0
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,607
The market at the lower price and return those chairs that you borrowed the

0
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,911
This is called selling the stock short

0
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,287
Which financial theory is based on the premise that the market is efficient

0
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
The price is right but

0
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:07,455
Actually market efficiency is an empirical matter when must tested to

0
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
Find out whether it is true that

0
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,063
The definition of an efficient financial market

0
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Is that

0
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,743
It's one in which prices always fully reflect available information one can identify three different forms

0
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
Forms of stock market efficiency

0
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:27,935
A strong semi strong and weak the idea of strong form efficient c is that the stock price will

0
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,799
Benefit information what does would imply is that inside information

0
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Nation could not exist in

0
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,127
Insiders are typically

0
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,687
The managers and directors of the company

0
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,783
We might have information that would cause the stock price to go up

0
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,111
It's good information or the stock price to go down if it's bad

0
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Bad information

0
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,719
And they might not have disclosed at the market one of the legal principles

0
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Of

0
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Share trading

0
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Is that

0
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
Insiders

0
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
Are not allowed to use it

0
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Insider information

0
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
To make money

0
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
So

0
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
Stock prices cannot be strong form efficient

0
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,383
Because if they were there were no such thing that's inside your information

0
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
We know that insider information exists

0
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
Chevy strong

0
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
Efficiency may exist

0
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
In semi-strong efficiency

0
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,415
All publicly available information

0
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
Is reflected in the stock price

0
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,535
This would imply that to an analyst you

0
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
Using public information

0
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
There's no way for that analyst through

0
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
You better analysis

0
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
To determine what stocks for underpriced

0
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Overpriced

0
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
And the third

0
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Stock market

0
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Justin c

0
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
This week former fishin c

0
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,735
What week form efficiency says is it the current price

0
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,783
Reflect pass prices

0
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
Another way of saying it is

0
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,647
Is it there are no gains to be had

0
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
From studying the

0
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
House

0
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Prices

0
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
If the market is weak form efficient

0
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Then

0
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Sharks would involve no

0
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
Under adjustment

0
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Moreover adjustment

0
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
Wendy in

0
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
Information hit the market

0
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,127
Then the information is instantly impounded in

0
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
In the market

0
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,223
Let's look at the path of a stock

0
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Price

0
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Our time

0
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
Assume there's no information

0
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
Vista market

0
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Until this point in time

0
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
At that point in time good information hits tomorrow

0
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
The market is efficient

0
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
Fully in pounds

0
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
Secret information

0
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
At that point

0
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
And the stock price

0
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Twin you

0
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Higher level

0
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
