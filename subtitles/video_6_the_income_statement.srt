Minus expenses

0
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
Let's look at this

0
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:46,848
Equation in

Represent

0
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:44,704
How did we get the numbers what we simplify them from the consolidated financial

0
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
Statements prepared under

0
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
International financial reporting standards

0
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,040
Here we've simplified and you can see that

0
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
Revenue is made up of two parts

0
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,648

I is actually owned by the state

0
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
Another way to say that

0
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327

For shareholders

0
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
Divided by the number of shares outstanding

0
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
Although earnings after tax are running to all of them

0
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
Assets

0
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
That are on the balance sheet

0
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
In fact there is consolidation

0
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Of

0
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
Japanese

0
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,063
Who is shares are not 100% owned by side effect

0
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
Beyond bricks
