00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,400
Introduce cash and statements of cash flows

0
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,424
You remember that

0
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,704
Did i show you this

0
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,728
Somewhat

0
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,264
Sketchy diagram

0
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,848
In the diagram talked about cash flow and investments

0
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
Cash flow from operations

0
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,736
In cash flows from financing the change the cash balance for the

0
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
The beginning of the year to a cash balance at the end of the year know what i'd like to do is to

0
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,744
Go into an actual company the company that i'd like to look at

0
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,536
Is alibaba group

0
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:38,912
Alibaba is the largest online and mobile commerce company in the world

0
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
Edit as

0
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,728
U.s. dollars

0
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
5.5 billion annual revenue

0
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,848
At about 1.3 billion

0
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640
Annual net income after-tax

0
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Tax

0
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,736
As you remember from the diagram operating

0
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:58,368
Cash flow is different from operating income and it's different from operating income

0
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
Because of

0
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,488
Rules and because of the change in

0
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
Net working capital

0
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,888
You remember that net working capital is non-cash short-term assets

0
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
-9 debt

0
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
Short-term liabilities

0
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
So going to alabama this is the consolidated statement of cash flows net income for

0
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
Alibaba

0
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
Into

0
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
2003

0
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736

0
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,648
Get the cash flow from operations for the much-larger for

0
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,952
14.47

0
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
Billy and jimmy b

0
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,304
Let's look at a few of the items that caused this difference

0
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
What item is this

0
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
Sharebeast

0
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
Compensation expense

0
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
This compensation ex

0
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,800
Spence was recognized as part of payroll and payment

0
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
To outside control

0
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Elephants

0
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
Georgia. expense but

0
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,712
Washing paint with cash it was paid with

0
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
Shares of the company

0
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
So these were expensive

0
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
That did not result in a period expenditure cash but

0
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,952
The clearly they were the giving of value

0
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
Netflix down at

0
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,072
Two other large items

0
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
We have

0
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
Receivables these are nascar receivables and lonely symbols and then following that we have some prepayments

0
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
So these are prepayment

0
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:24,128
Buy alibaba to its suppliers and

0
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,992
These are increases in short-term assets and so of course

0
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:34,112
The result in a reduction of cash flow from operations

0
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,208
But net working capital requirement also included in on

0
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44,608
Peebles and as you can see there a two large increases in non-debt payables

0
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,936
This is accrued expenses accounts payable and liabilities

0
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,080
Convergence deposits so these are deposits of merchants and their customers of alibaba

0
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,640
As you can see these 2 items

0
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
In total

0
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Far exceed

0
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
The increase in shore

0
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:05,856
Short-term non-cash assets the net effect is that the net cash provided

0
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
Provided by operating activities

0
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,256
Is considerably larger than the net income of alibaba

0
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
In addition

0
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Net operating cash flow

0
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
There are two other major can

0
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Is a change in

0
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448

00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984

00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
The other is fine

00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
Training first time

0
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152

These 2 items

00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Financing

0
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
With a little bit of

0
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
Cash left over

0
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
Turning to the third area

0
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Cash flows from

0
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Activities

0
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
In 2013

0
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
There was a tremendous amount of activity in

0
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Factor with a major restructuring of

0
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
Alibaba

0
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
The capital structure

0
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
If you

00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
Issuance

0
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839

Every purchase of or

00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655

00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
Issuance of convey

The repurchase of the equity of alibaba.com

0
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
And there was

0
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
Little activity

0
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
Bank borrowings

0
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
But the net effect was

0
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Relatively small

0
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Cash flow

0
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
From financing app

0
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807

So the total

Cash flow

00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255

00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
Little cash flow to alibaba

Canada ali baba's managerial balance sheet

0
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,951
Three things are striking especially if you look at the common size balance sheet

0
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
The common size balance sheet

0
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
Is simply thai

0
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
Taking the manager of balance sheet

0
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:28,191
When dividing each item by total assets this gives you 4

0
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Each item

0
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
A percentage of total assets and

0
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
That allows comparison

0
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Cross years

0
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
In between different companies

0
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Three things are striking

0
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
First of all the rearrangement of financing

0
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
2000 + 12 - 2000 +

0
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
13

0
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,695
You can see the equity dropped from 96% of financing down

0
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
Down to 38%

0
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Short-term debt increase

0
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Reese's

0
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
And long-term debt come from

0
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
02

0
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,703
50% secondly working capital requirement is negative

0
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,799
Financing of alibaba's operating activities

0
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
We're not dead

0
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615

John cash receivables and inventories

0
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Is a part of

0
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
The company's model

0
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
And it's

0
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
Relatively permanent

0
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
An increasing

0
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,231
And thirdly alibaba has very large cash balances it has 30

0
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
32.6

0
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279

The need for cash increases with

0
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,079
The volatility of operating cash flows and

0
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
An investment opportunities

0
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
The bank may allow you to draw lines of credit

0
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
Increases a company's liquidity

0
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
A line of credit would be as good as cash

0
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,855
If the bank would always lend you money whenever you want it

00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,695
