0
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Before we go any farther in the

0
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:06,144
Series of pictures i want to make a few comments about banks

0
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,192
Banks are special

0
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:14,336
They are among the most regulated institutions in the world and they are very different from non-financial corporations

0
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,128
Their differences

0
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,712
Primarily stem from their ability to take deposits

0
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
I deposit

0
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,784
Is a kind of loan when

0
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,856
When you lend money to a friend you know to give me the loan

0
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:30,976
When you lend money to a corporation in general you are aware of the credit risk of that loan

0
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,792
Get when you make a loan to a bank

0
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,840
You think you have money in the back

0
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
In fact you just let it be

0
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,752
Deposits are different from other loans however be

0
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,032
Because there are

0
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,336
Offers made by bank

0
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
To the general public

0
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
To accept loans

0
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:53,760
Repairable on demand or at short notice so

0
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,808
So these two characteristics

0
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
The fact that they are made to the general public and that the fact that they re payable on demand orange short note

0
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,536
This means that the difference of the loans

0
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
And it's this difference that give

0
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,656
Bank deposits their liquidity

0
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
And make bank deposits

0
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,984
Societies money

0
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,360
Most payments in the world today are made through exchanging bank deposits

0
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,200
Banks are able to exchange deposits because

0
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,528
Because not only can they change the beneficiary of

0
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,808
A deposit

0
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,856
That is held in their own bank

0
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,928
But they can also instruct the central bank

0
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,024
Debit their own account with the central bank

0
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Penn credit

0
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
The account of another bank

0
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,656
For the benefit of the ultimate pee

0
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
This membership of the payment system

0
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,568
That allows banks to dominate payments in our society as well

0
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
Let's look at the end report

0
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
Owl city group

0
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:58,272
One of the largest financial institutions in the world and you can see that

0
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,880
Citibank also has a statement of income and balance sheet

0
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
If we choose to summarize the balance sheet of citibank into a managerial balance sheet

0
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,376
Then we find shaped differently

0
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
From that of other balance sheet we've looked at

0
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
First of all it

0
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
It's highly leveraged

0
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
The equity of city

0
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,128

13%

0
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Secondly it

0
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,552
It relies tremendously on short-term debt

0
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
It's short-term debt

0
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,648
Rangers from 68 -

0
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,208
Is 72% of the balance sheet

0
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
The right away if

0
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
If we use the same standards as we used for non-bank corporations we would save the bank have no solvency

0
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,728
And load acquitted most of the bank

0
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Fixed assets

0
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,336
Are not property plant and equipment all they are in

0
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Investments

0
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,968
And loans to consumers and corporations and the other assets

0
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
Which include

0
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
Physical fixed assets

0
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
Are only a tiny fraction of the balance sheet

0
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672

00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488

Are about twice the size of speakers

0
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,968
Global banks are among the largest corporations in the world by assets

0
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,784
Largest liability is deposits

0
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
