00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,376
Today i want to talk about dcf or discounted cash flow analysis

0
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,680
Mini finance courses start with

0
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,704
Dcf

0
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
Start with a

0
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,336
Net present value analysis the fundamental principle and finance

0
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:18,432
Is there a business proposal will raise from value only if the

0
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,480
Present value of expected to

0
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,272
Future cash flows

0
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:26,112
Exceed initial cash outlay in a perfect market

0
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,904
Competitive buyers for

0
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440

0
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,512
Hillbilly all positive expected net

00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,352
Can straps the reason why

00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,192
The great thinker of the 19th century

0
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
Dubbed economics the dismal science to perfectly competitive market positive npv projects doing

0
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872
Not exist

0
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,712
Shake your analyst at you see a positive tv project

0
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,016
You've got to stop and ask yourself

0
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:58,368
What part of perfectly competitive economics is missing here that

0
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,904
Enable this project

0
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
Positive npv

Deposited and dvd

0
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
Evidence of an economic rent

0
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
Advent

0
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
The returned

0
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
The productive

0
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Resource

0
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,448
Wishing a good or service is greater

0
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,984
The cost

0
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
I love

0
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,032
Action

0
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Managers

0
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,640
Maximize shareholder value are driven to be rent seekers

0
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
Atmosphere look up project should

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
2002 fire

0
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,272
Where the monopoly rents arise from man

0
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,344
Managers see value propositions they look for

0
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,904
Parts and services that create

0
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Value for

0
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,952
4 + users the

0
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,024
Good or service that's created to be a must-buy

0
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:42,912
The future is going to pay a premium over the cost of production good and pv projects are now

0
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Large

00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
My margin and

0
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
And more importantly

0
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
With significant barriers to entry

0
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
And they fit the resources of a company

0
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
Dallas score

0
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
Fortify

0
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
Value

0
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,248
An expected cash flows and discount those to present value

0
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,856
So here's the fundamental principle of finance the net present value of a project

0
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,648
Mississippi equal to

0
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
A series of cash flows

0
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,048
The cash flows start at time zero and recede into the

0
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Far future

0
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
Here represented by the infinity sign

0
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
Each cash flow

0
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
Is discounted at a cost of capital

0
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
I've identified decay heroes the weighted average cost of capital which will come to an elite of actor the returned that capital

0
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,200
Each year's cash flow is discounted

0
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Christian family

0
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
Find appropriate discount factor

0
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
And the question is

0
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
Is the total sum grade

0
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Raiden zero

0
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,976
Note that only cash matters we bring it to present value

0
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,792
Silver bringing it back to x 0

0
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
These are expectations

0
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
Within the numerator

0
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
This is the expectation at x 0

0
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,544
Have a future cash flow for these are projections what

0
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,384
Once again if mpv is lesson zero value of destroyed

0
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,456
Imdb is greater than zero value of created

0
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,296
If we're dealing with a company whose shares are publicly traded

0
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
And the information becomes public on a

0
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
The given day

0
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,976
Did the increase in the capitalization of the shares will

0
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
Will equal net present value

0
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Alpha project

0
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,120
I'm going to talk a little bit about discounting this

0
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
Discounting instantly the division buy discount factor

0
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,568
Can i convert future expected cash flows into their equivalent value today

0
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
Will cover the activation of the discount rate

0
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
Can the cost of capital schedule

0
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,736
We will cover the identifying of cash flows

0
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
In the

0
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Capital budgeting discussion

0
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
Here we'll just look at the mechanics of discounting

0
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
The mechanics of discounting

0
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,536
Are the same as the mechanics of interest let's see the year one race one percent that

0
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
That means we'd be in different between having

0
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
Hundred and $1 in one year and

0
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
$100 today show

0
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,800
To the future value is simply the present value times 1 plus 2 inch

0
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Interest rate

0
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Can the interest rate is

0
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
1%

0
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
4.012

0
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
Future value in 100

0
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,064
Times 1.01 the present value is simply the future value

0
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Discounted

0
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
@ 1 + 3

0
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
Rate of return for that appropriate horizon gif

00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Square

00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
Expecting $101 in one year's time

0
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Time in the in

0
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
Interest rate is 1%

0
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,679
And we discounted that 1.01

0
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
Can a present value of 100

0
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:32,127
If your promised $200 in one year for the price of $195 paid today the present value of the out

0
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
Uploaded $95

0
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,527
The present value of the inflow is simply 200 divided by 1.01

0
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
Which of the hundred $98.02

0
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
Net present value of $298.02

0
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,999
Midas on $95 what you have to pay out today

0
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
$3.02

0
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
The future value of the outflow is $195 times 1.010 out of $96 to the

0
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
Annette future value is

0
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
$200

0
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,103
Mercedes $96.95 or $3.05

0
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
You accept the deal

0
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
Note that

0
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
We could calculate that future values

0
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
Or we could calculate net present value

0
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
But we tend to

0
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
Calculate net present value in finance because

0
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Because there is only one time

0
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
X 0 today

0
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
And yet there's an infinite number of

0
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
Future x

0
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
It's better to

00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583

00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
What the principle of

00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
Of equating

0
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Cash flows to a

0
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Single point in time

0
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Is the same but

0
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Calculations that

0
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
That i've just given

0
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,527
Are only for a one-year horizon interested typically quoted at a rate per annum if the rate is constant

0
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,367
At the one-year rate for in years we can calculate

0
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
Future value or present value

0
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
With respect to

00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279

Giving a future value and present value

0
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,647
