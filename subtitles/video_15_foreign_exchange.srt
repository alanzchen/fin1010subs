00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Trades are electron

0
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,856
That's an increase over the last three years three years ago

0
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
Only about a third or electronic

0
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:41,280
And the market is dominated by banks brokers pension funds insurance companies hedge funds

0
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,352
My data come from the bank for international settlements

0
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,192
Triennial survey this siri was completed in april 2000 and

0
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
13

0
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
And you can see that

0
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
Non-financial participants in the

0
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
The market

0
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
Only account for about one-tenth the

0
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
The market

0
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
The rest are banks

0
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736
And other financial institute

0
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,064
Give me three types of transactions that

0
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Dominate the foreign exchange

0
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
Games market

0
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Spot

0
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
Forward and swap

0
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Spot transactions

0
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:15,584
Are the price of foreign exchange contracted now for immediate delivery

0
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
Outright forward transactions

0
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
Are the price of foreign exchange

0
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Contracted today for

0
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
For some delivery

0
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
At a specified future time

0
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
The foreign exchange swap

0
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
Is essentially a derivative

0
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
It's a derivative

0
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,088
Which is identical to the simultaneous purchase of foreign exchange spot

0
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,392
And the sale of foreign exchange

0
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
It's also identical to

0
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
28 landing in one currency

0
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072

Are foreign exchange markets i said the largest market in the world

0
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776

0
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
Daily turnover

0
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
In

0
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
Billions of us dollars per day

0
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,968
As you can see the turnover is about 5.32

0
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
Billion dollars

0
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,600

0
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
For once every 14 days

0
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
The largest transactions

0
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
By volume

0
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
Are foreign exchange swaps

0
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Spot transactions

0
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
One third of the amount

0
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
Adoptions

0
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439

0
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791

Account for about 1% of transactions

0
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,191
A currency swap is like a foreign exchange swap

0
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,031
Where foreign exchange swap has only two pairs of payments

0
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,871
One at the beginning and one at the end of the transaction

0
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,431

00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
Involves two counterparties

0
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
And to central banks

0
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,263
