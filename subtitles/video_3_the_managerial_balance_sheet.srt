That's not an example of a publicly listed company

00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,784
How we choose puppy listed companies because they are

0
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:27,648

00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
Are the outfits

0
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376

What the corporation owns is divided in the manager of balance sheet into three parts

0
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
The residual claims

0
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
Are the equity claims

0
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,480
These are residual claims all the assets

0
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,808
Are liabilities are divided into two parts

0
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
At one part is

0
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
And the other part is long term

0
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
Death

0
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
The short-term debt

0
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,584
The steps that occur within the space of the year

0
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
In the long-term debt

0
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
Are debts that are no

0
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Longer than one year

0
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Cities are

0
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Claims

0
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
Liability holders

0
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Yet holders

0
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
And these are claims of

0
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
Are equity holders

0
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:02,528
Can you note that all these are claims of active investors

0
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
The debt holders

0
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,928
What hold the death of the corporation because he loves them return the equity holders

0
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,488
What hold the equity of a corporation

0
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
Kevin elston and expected return

0
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,888
On the right hand side we're also going to divide the balance sheet

0
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
N23

0
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
Three categories

0
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,496
In the first category is cash

0
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:27,104
So this is really cash and short-term investments

0
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,408
Money market investments

0
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,272
Temperature in a year and addicted typically in liquid

0
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
And are not the operating invest

0
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
Edmonds theatre financial investments

0
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Audi corporation

0
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
To the cash

0
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
Is a fine

0
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,328
Financial items that we have two other categories and those are the network

0
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
Working capital requirement

0
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
Andy fixed

0
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Assets

0
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,752
I'll just go on a little while to talk about the network

0
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Capital

0
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Farming

0
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
First of all what i like to do it out a little bit of color to

0
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
Diagram and so it's not quite

0
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
In

0
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
Natural balance sheet we

0
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
We have

0
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Just

0
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,416
Claims of investors on the right hand side

0
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
And on the left hand side

0
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,791
That we have consolidated into the working cow

0
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
Capital requirement

0
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,423
All of the non cash and non-cash equivalent and

0
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
Avalon short-term debt

0
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
Aspects of working capital

0
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,335
And then below that we have sex

0
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
Fixed assets for charts of corporation

0
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,455
That are of maturity longer than

0
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
What year

0
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
Getting the various items from

0
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
The assets

0
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Attend

0
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
The liabilities and

0
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,695
Shareholders equity

0
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,999
Into the six items

0
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
I'm the manager about sheet

0
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
Is somewhat of an art

0
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
Are some items such as cash it

0
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,751
It's relatively easy fixed assets is largely pro

0
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
Property plant and equipment

0
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Short-term debt

0
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Is clearly

0
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Short-term borrowings and

0
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Of the long-term debt

0
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
Long-term desert little more complex clearly it includes long-term debt for the balance sheet for we've also include

0
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
Who did accrued pension and

0
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
Severance

0
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
Applications

0
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
Because these are investments

0
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
By the pictures

0
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,959
Holders on which toyota corporation is obliged to give a reasonable return after long-term

0
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Penalties

0
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
How we check the

0
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
The footnotes

0
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,847
And in this case there's no information

0
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,943
Show me included those as long-term debt assuming those are from

0
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
Active investors

0
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,807
The treatment of deferred income taxes

0
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,159
One of the long-term liabilities of toyota motor corporation

0
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,559
If an art in this case we have taken this liability which represents

0
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
Texas that would be due if the

0
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
The accounting conventions with

0
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,983
With the same conventions as those used by the taxes

0
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,079
Dorothy's tax is the mayfield you in future years

0
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,711
But if these deferred income taxes are replaced as the company grows there

0
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:17,343
Did the actual amount mean never in the foreseeable future actually have to be repaid

0
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
In this case

0
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
Biddeford income taxes could

0
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,767
Could be treated as a part of equity recently added

0
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
Deferred income tax liability

0
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
Antiquity

0
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
You have the

0
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
Equity

0
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,495
From the balance sheet and we've added to that deferred inc

0
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Income tax

0
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
Liabilities

0
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,943
Subtracted another number over here deferred income tax assets amounts that have been

0
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,319
Paid to the tax authorities but that have not yet been recognized

0
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,623
Through the accounting statements

0
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,951
Because the income was recognized my tax wanted you

0
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
What was not recognized

0
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
From

0
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,559
An accounting point of view

0
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,167
These look like prepayment of taxes and therefore

0
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
They are a deferred tax

0
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Asset

0
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
He's actually come from other assets they're sitting here as non-current finance

0
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Receivables

0
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
When is other category if you go to footnotes

0
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
Define that

0
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Of that

0
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,111
569 billion yen

0
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
100 billion

0
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Are actually

0
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
Deferred tax assets into

0
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
2000

0
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,607
13 + 133 billion

0
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
When are deferred tax assets

0
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Can 2004

0
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
14 what we've done with those

0
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
Is that we have subtracted them

0
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,127
From the fixed assets

0
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Can subtract them

0
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
From the equity

0
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
There's a subtraction from the fixed assets

0
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
If there is

0
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Traction

0
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
From equity

0
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
What we're in effect saving

0
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Is that

0
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
That

0
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Prepayment

0
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,047
Have taxes should not be considered as a capitalised asset

0
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
And that

0
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
Perhaps in the first

0
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
Foreseeable future that

0
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
That will never be

0
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
Claimed back by the court

0
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,799
Corporation add value that is already going out as an expense

0
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
So we should detect it from both equity

0
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
Can fixed assets

0
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,271
The final simplification and breaths the most complex simplification with

0
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
Within the manager or balance sheet

0
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,391
Concerns net working capital requirement

0
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,695
Here we add up all the components

0
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
Have a non-cash current assets

0
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,071
10 subtract all of the components

0
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Oven on deck

0
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
Current liabilities

0
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,727
Give us a net working capital requirement

0
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,055
And that's how you put together a managerial balance sheet

0
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,407
So you see what we want to go from the somewhat

0
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
Flex

0
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
Accounting statements

0
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
Into this somewhat simplified

0
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:02,207
Six category manager or balance sheet there is summer circle t that's lost us

0
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,583
Nassau financial analyst have to understand that this settled he is lost

0
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
And you have to often go into the footnotes

0
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
To understand what

0
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Which assumptions you're making an

0
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,079
And why you're making assumptions in order to achieve

0
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
A model

0
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
Distractible

0
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
A model that you can use it

0
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,783
Give the formula that we teach in the finance class

0
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,367
Advantage of balance sheet is a

0
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
First look

0
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Apps

0
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,719
How we can use simplifications

0
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,047
Financial models require certifications

0
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,911
The endless should always understand this applications that he or she uses

0
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
In order to appreciate the output from
