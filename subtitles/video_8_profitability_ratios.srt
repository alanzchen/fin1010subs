Fidelity

00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,984
Ratios are simply quotients where

0
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,544
Where we divide one number by 2nd

0
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
And the numbers come from

0
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,360
From the financial statements

0
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384

Balance sheet the common size balance sheet

0
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,672
Simply divided each number on the balance sheet

00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,488
By total assets you're able to develop race

00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:36,608
Facials that can be compared across years and across companies to remember

00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144

00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,128
We're able to compare alibaba

00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968

00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
Shareholders

0
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:25,760
We've reduced those numbers simply by dividing each number on the income statement

0
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
Revenue

00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600

00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,848
New to the idea of

Shareholders have

00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
And the dividend payout ratio is

Caused by apple

So much as it is

00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,160
But a decision to maintain a constant never

Yeah and pressure into

00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
That dividend was kept on

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008

00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
However

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Dividend per share

Earnings per share

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
In 2000 and

0
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
And it didn't

The drop

Earnings after taxes

0
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
The shareholders

0
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
The dividend payout ratio

0
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
What app for

00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048

0
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
2/60

0
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
Ratios are a flexible and useful family of tools at the analyst looks at ratios over time

0
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Time

0
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,336
And between companies any books that the

0
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,408
Differences or consistency of the ratios

0
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,808
I as long as we have a good analytical reason for calculating a set of ratios and as long as the animals control

0
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
A compelling story

0
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
About the ratios

0
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,952
10 ratio analysis that is performed is used for

0
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,536
The question is can the analyst tell a good story

0
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
What is happening in the company

0
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
Why is it happening

0
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
Now let's look at a set of ratio is an

0
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Andis concerned

0
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Composition of

0
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
Return on equity

0
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
Return on equity or roa

0
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
Is the most broad measure of perform

0
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:08,064
Available from ratios that are calculated from annual accounting statements of

0
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Alpha company

0
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,672
Far away is simply the earnings after tax that

0
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
That are attributable to shareholders

0
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,047
Divided by shareholders equity

0
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
I just like to go into the definition

0
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Ave

0
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Equity forum

0
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
From the point of view of the roex

0
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Depression

0
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
First note that

0
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
Earnings

0
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
Reported on the income statement

0
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,687
Are earnings over a. of time typically a year

0
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
I hear of showing earnings from. 02

0
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
. 1

0
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Equity

0
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,903
Is a stock at a given point in time

0
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,767
Typically the financial statements for show earnings for a year

0
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,327
And the ending equity for the year

0
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,399
So we have a time inconsistency here

0
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
We could calculate

0
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Re

0
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Simply as

0
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
The earnings over the period

0
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
/ and equity

0
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
This is the simplest way because

0
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
Guys were typically given the balance sheet of fp

0
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Period end

0
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Amber given the earnings

0
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
For the period

0
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
But you can see it somewhat inconsistent

0
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,487
Because you're saying that there's a return to equity

0
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
Where the equity is

0
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
Is the final equity

0
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,119
Another possibility that we could use

0
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
His weed use the

0
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Earnings

0
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
For the period

0
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
Divided by the equity at the beginning of the period

0
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
This is a certain logic

0
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
Investors are always looking at one year

0
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
Time horizons

0
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,247
Method that we use in this course

0
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
Looks at

0
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Roa

0
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
As the earnings

0
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,439
/ the average equity over the period

0
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,767
I answer the question which is the appropriate method

0
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,071
By endorsing the third method

0
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,399
But no this is not an absolute right or wrong

0
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,215
How do you frequently see the other two methods when

0
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,823
When you look at the ratio analysis of roi for other analysts

0
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
We returned it

0
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
To the state

0
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,271
Statements of toyota motor corporation in order to calculate return on equity

0
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
And as you can see we are

0
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
You're using

0
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,647
The income attributable to shareholders from

0
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
For the income statement

0
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,487
Amber dividing it by an average of

0
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
Two numbers from the balance sheet

0
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
Going to the balance sheet

0
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
You can see the word f***

0
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Focusing on

0
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
The

0
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,751
Equity as defined by the managerial balance sheet

0
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
Who are equity here

0
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Is the

0
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,199
Top book equity and we have an average of the beginning and ending year

0
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Equity

0
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
From the balance sheet

0
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
The return on equity

0
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,855
Shareholders of toyota motor corporation

00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135

0
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,887
We're also going to look at

00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Ii

0
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935

0
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,287
When looking at return on equity and this company is the

00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
The rose group

Creasing

0
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,951
One can analyze the return on equity

0
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
By its component part

00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Christoval

0
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,887
One can break return on equity which is simply earnings after tax / equity

0
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
Into two parts by multiplying bernie

0
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
Earnings after taxes

0
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,567
/ equity x 1 or assets / assets

0
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
And shifting the

0
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Terms

0
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
Define that

0
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
Return on equity

0
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
Simply return on assets

Leverage

0
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,391
We can further decompose return on equity by

0
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,695
Decomposing return on assets

0
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Return on assets

0
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,071
Can be decomposed into return on sales

0
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,399
Data stay running after tax divided by sales

0
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447

Roa

0
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,063
Can be broken into roa x leverage

0
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Roa

0
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
Can be broken into ros

00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
Over assets

0
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
Going back to whole foods

0
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
Rather high but

0
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
Dropping roa one

0
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
One can see that

0
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,007
Operating efficiency that it's a earnings after taxes

0
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,567
Over sales which is the return on sales

0
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Having roughly constant

0
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:56,223
The same is also true with acid deficiency this is the asset turnover

0
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
Asset turnover is roughly constant

0
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
What has changed

0
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Yes

0
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
Leverage has dropped

0
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
From

0
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,719

0
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
2.58 times

0
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
Drop of leverage

0
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Has reduced

0
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
The roa

0
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,679
For toyota the increase in

0
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Return on equity is

0
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
It's largely driven

0
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
By the operating efficiency

0
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
I have to say the return on sales

0
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Running after taxes

0
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Divided by sales

0
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
Has gone from about 2%

0
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
How about san fran

0
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
There's also been an increase in

0
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:38,207
Acid deficiency or in sales turnover that's gone up slightly but net

0
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Leverage

0
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
Actually

0
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Decreased slightly

0
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,095
So these two factors primarily the

0
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,167
The sales margin return on sales

0
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Accounts for the

0
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Rapid increase

0
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
Frweed

0
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
At the end of the day however

0
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,615
The roa of hoffman the rose is still

0
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,175
Much larger than the roa

0
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943

0
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,527
Toyota would anybody wish to buy toyota shares

0
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,343
Given the army is so much higher for

00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
4 hoffman laroche

0
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Vin for toyota

0
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
The answer of course is yes

0
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
The answer comes

0
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
From the difference between the

0
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
Market price

0
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,191
At which the shares of hoffman-laroche can be bought

0
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
Relative to their book price

0
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799

Price-earnings ratio is

00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Is the earnings yield

0
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,975
The earnings yield is an analog

Shareholders have to pay in order to get that yield

0
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,895
The earnings yield of course is more volatile

0
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,479
Then return on equity using the

Book value of the company

0
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,647
But the earnings yield is forward-looking for both book returns

0
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
And market returns

0
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
