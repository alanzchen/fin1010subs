0
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
I'd like to spend a little time to talk

0
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,328
Talk about growth

0
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,608
In the last few

0
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,680
Electric repair looking at various ratio was

0
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,960
Pengrowth actually could be

0
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,496
Be considered a ratio

0
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
We see the destructive effect

0
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,336
Of unrestrained growth

0
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,920
At same time as we see the benefits we're escaping from

0
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,456
Property for everyone

0
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,736
How can our grasp

0
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,552
Previous lecturer i mentioned that the default go

0
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
Finances

0
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624
Maximizing shareholder wealth

0
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
Deco pushes managers

0
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,720
To pursue profitable growth

0
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,536
If we as a society believe

0
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,328
Pet unrestrained growth

0
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
Is destructive

0
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,912
The only way to incentivize managers approach

0
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
Hope it leads to death

0
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
Sign policies

0
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
Lipstick

0
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Social cost

0
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,288
Are put in the

0
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,848
Structures of firms

0
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,176
Responsible managers will respond appropriately

0
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Growth will

0
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,272
Tempered that means that responsible managers

0
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,808
Should be in the forefront of

0
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
Vision

0
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,856
The social costs

0
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
Of their actions

0
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,000
And so they can help craft policies that allowed this internalization

0
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
Five economic externalities

0
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
David recent article

0
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,912
Kinsey published by three of its researchers

0
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
That have the title

0
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,752
Grow fast or die slow

0
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
Article was written about the software industry

0
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
Treat and the researchers came to the conclusion

0
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
That in the software industry

0
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,016
Over the last 30 years companies did not grow fast

0
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
Then basically

0
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
They were highly addressed

0
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
And likely to die

0
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
Guy

0
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,512
The reasons for this in software is it is very low barriers to entry patents and software

0
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Fort worth

0
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,584
Very much because they can be easily

0
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Circumnavigated

0
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,448
The math of economies of scale and there is abstention brand recognition

0
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
Noah from me to grow quickly

0
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
To achieve that recognition and their economies of scale

0
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,920
Near me not be true and other industries and an analyst has

0
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
After analyzed

0
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
The effects of growth and

0
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
And the industry structure

0
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
Sherman what the

0
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,368
Appropriate growth rate for a firm its

0
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
I've been talking about growth rates

0
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,768
So let's put it in numerical terms the appropriate row 3 to use in the car

0
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
Compound annual growth rate

0
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
Cagr

0
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
Multi-year

0
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
Into a standard annual compound growth

0
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
Penguin calculate that something by taking a price

0
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
Price relative

0
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
Ken. value

0
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
/ the zero. value and

0
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Raising up the power

0
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
Power 104 in

0
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,784
Where in is the number of year periods are there

0
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Subtract 1 from now

0
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
Obviously if x 0 is reduced to

0
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Near zero

0
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
Then the compound annual growth rate explodes

0
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
A second related problem is

0
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
The

0
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
Variables

0
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,168
Go through 0 during the period self

0
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Love me

0
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Positive or negative value

0
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
What's the negative to a positive value

0
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
That means that the growth rate of someone time

0
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Calgon twins

0
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
And finally

0
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
50

0
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,016
Values are small relative the other accounts on

0
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
An income statement

0
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
Bounce sheet

0
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,624
Then even if a compound annual growth rate is high

0
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Hi

0
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Then it might not be

0
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Be very

0
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Time calculator

0
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
Three-year compound annual growth

0
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,328
Retreat energy can see what we do it 72

0
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,656
Take me last year 2014 / the first year

0
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
The power point

0
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
.5 + 2

0
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
1 given

0
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
Getting a very low growth rate

0
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
.7%

0
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Annual come

0
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
Compound growth rate

0
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Lovin you

0
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
Bring it together with an n

0
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
Increase of 13

0
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
1%

0
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,392
Appreciation and amortization and depletion

0
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,440
Then that translates in

0
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Earnings

0
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
Going to the balance sheet

0
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
One can see that total assets are

0
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Are growing at a

0
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
The compound annual growth rate

0
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
Curious into a positive

0
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,056
40% per year over the

0
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
2 years

0
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,896
But since both of these are negative numbers

0
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:05,248
What were seen is an increase in the negative amount of the working capital requirement

0
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Financing

0
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
March of the

About roach weed

0
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
We have one two three

0
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
4 years of data

0
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
And that means that

0
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
What are our compound annual growth rate

0
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Is calculated by raising

00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
Price relative

0
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
You can see that for

00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Roshe

0
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823

Percent per annum

0
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
At these represent

0
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,295
Only about 5% of

Visa purchases by rush

00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
Of patents

0
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
And the development in

0
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
Internally through research of patents

0
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
Unlike the software industry

As the new equity from the returned on

Capital structure

0
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,767
And if a company grows by 10% that

0
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
That 10% growth

0
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,375
Will have to be supported by a growth in a set

0
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
So that she needs a proportionate girl

And then i have to be financed

0
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
If the capital structure is to remain the same short-term debt and

0
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,295

If the payout rate is 50%

00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
Sales meet assets to generate the growth

0
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,647
The couch cushion for liquidity the working capital requirement

0
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
And fixed assets

0
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,255
Property including intellectual property plant and equipment

0
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
A default assumption that

0
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,607
That is to say a good starting point assumption

0
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Is the growth in

0
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,727
Sales requires a proportionate grow in assets

0
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,335
Of course if the company has massive economies of scale as to some song

0
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,407
Software network base forms this assumption may be wrong

0
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:18,271
Let's keep it for the moment let's also assume that tapping equity markets is difficult

0
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,623
The firm wishes to keep its current capital structure in this case this

0
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
Self sustainable growth rate

0
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
Can be calculated as

0
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
The retention rate

0
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
X 3 turn on equity

0
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
Retention rate is simply the

0
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:37,983
The earnings per share minus the dividend per share divided by the earnings per share times the return on investment

0
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Let's look

0
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
Look at josh's cell

00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Stainable growth rate

0
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
The retention rate

0
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Is a

0
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
About 28%

0
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
In

0
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
2014

0
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
Having dropped from 40%

0
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
In 2013

0
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
Is low retention rates they are x

0
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
5 very high returns on equity

0
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
The shelf sustainable growth rate

0
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
Rangers in the three years that we have data for

00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
From 14% to

0
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
- 28%

0
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,727
And this self sustainable growth rate

0
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Is my

0
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
Much higher

0
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
In the compound annual growth rate

0
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
In sales

0
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
For the compound annual growth rate

0
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
That we see on the balance sheet

0
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Giving plenty of room

0
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551

00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
It had retention rates of the

0
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
57% witch

0
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Dropped

0
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,191
- 39% its return on equity was relatively low

0
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
So when you multiply through the

0
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
Retention rate times the return on equity

0
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,127
We find a self sustainable growth rate

0
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
Ranging from 3 to

0
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
About 7%

0
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,015
Now that's sustainable growth rate

0
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
Actually

0
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,623
Exceeds the growth rate in revenues

0
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
But if you look at the

0
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,487
Crossfit in assets on the balance sheet

0
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,327
You can see the growth and axis exceeding the self sustainable growth rate

0
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,887
Which leads one to believe that

0
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Side effects

0
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,519

.7 ways to make about growth

0
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
Obviously growth can be

00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Be critical to the

00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
The firm analyzing the financial statements

0
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,927
Using compound annual growth rates is

0
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
Is there a easy and i can help

0
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Help the allies gain insight into the

0
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,839
The firm sustainability of growth should be analyzed

0
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
Growth needs

0
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Financing

0
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
And financing is expensive

0
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,335
So calculating that are self sustainable growth rate is useful and within public policy growth

0
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Has it

00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Applications for

00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
For sustainability
