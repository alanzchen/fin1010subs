0
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,584
I want to see if you were today about forecasts

0
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:09,472
Forecasting is essential in finance because finance deals with the future

0
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,312
Financial statements which is a major source of information

0
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,872
For finance are dealing with the past

0
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,688
Conceal we have a small problem here

0
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,016
When it deals with the future because investors are basing

0
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,320
Their pricing of securities and

0
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,368
And their investment in securities

0
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,952
On the expected cash flows to those securities

0
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,536
Treasures have to protect cash flows in order to determine

0
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,864
Appropriate cash balances and in order to determine the

0
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
The best capital structure

0
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:45,056
Linder's used forecast to analyze credit worthiness in finance we typically use what are called pro

0
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,360
Proform accounting statements

0
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,384
Pro forma

0
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,968
Literally means according to the standard form its last

0
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,248
Accountants

0
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,296
Prepare performance that

0
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,648
Show account results as if an unusual event had not occurred to

0
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
Let's see there's a merger or a

0
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,584
Spinoff of a part of a company that accountants typically want to show the investors with the company would have looked like

0
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,936
Had that event not occurred and so the investors compare lie

0
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
Like with like if they're comparing

0
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
1 years

0
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,312
Earnings for the extraordinary event occurred

0
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
The previous year's earnings

0
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
It didn't occur

0
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,480
This is basically asking the what if question

0
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
What if

0
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
Something

0
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,368
Kura door didn't occur in the pro forma forecast that we make

0
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
Ashley

0
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
What if

0
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
Question

0
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,560
What if certain assumptions are fulfilled what does that do for the future of a company

0
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Clearly

0
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144
Forecasts are wrong but you

0
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,728
You can if you are good for caster specified

0
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
Confidence intervals

0
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Around a forecast

0
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
Nearby substituting error 4

0
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
The chaos

0
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
Projected sales

0
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
Are the most important part

0
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
In

0
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,552
Forecasting the financial statements

0
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
Typically one uses that

0
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,136
The gross in sales

0
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
As the same growth number by

0
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
5 which one

0
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Inflates

0
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
Balance sheet items

0
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
In working capital requirement

0
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,472
And cost balances when using the capital budget the forecast fixed assets

0
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Edwin uses

0
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,848
Long-term financing of those capital assets in

0
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
In order to

0
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
Set

0
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,456
Long-term financing within the projections

0
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,064
Typically when was making for cats one wishes to have an output that

0
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,416
What is the short-term financing or indeed the total financing that is needed

0
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,976
Short-term financing or the total financing

0
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
Typically a plug

0
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,144
Let's go to some forecast here these are forecast for a fictitious company

0
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,984
Call hatcher enterprises and as you can see we've got

0
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:55,104
Numbers from the past 2012 2013 2014 for the

0
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
The income statement

0
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Beat down cheat

0
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Candy

0
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Cash flow statement

0
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
The cash flow statement

0
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Course it is

0
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,832
Is a statement that is derived from the income statement

0
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
And the balance sheet

0
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
So you can see i have developed

0
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
Warmest the top line

0
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
Is the revenue line

0
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
The revenue line

0
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Is

0
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
X

0
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
The crow straight

0
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,936
Here i have a growth rate

0
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
10%

0
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
1 conway ave

0
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Looking at the growth rate

0
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Would be to say well

0
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
What is the gross

0
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Growth rate italy

0
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
Racine

0
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,016
Over the last few years and human calculator

0
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
Go straight the compound growth rate

0
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
As the

0
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,952
2014 revenue divided for the 2012 revenue

0
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
The power

0
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
.5

0
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
Subtract 1

0
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
That gives us our historical girl

0
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Filtrate

0
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:53,472
And then we can use that historical growth rate to generate a series of

0
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
Cost of goods sold

0
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,336
And other expenses assumptions

0
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
Shakira were in inflating

0
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
The cost of goods sold

0
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,736
And other expenses by the same number

0
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
We're also inflating

0
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,880
Cash capital requirements of accounts receivable inventory

0
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,208
And trade payables by exactly that

0
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
That seems

0
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
Figure you can see that i have input for

0
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
For the mortgage found exactly the same

0
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:26,495
Number as a previous year of the fluctuated in past years i've said what we can use exactly the same

0
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,311
Fixed assets that we had in previous years this

0
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
This is an assumption

0
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
That needs to be checked with the company

0
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Handr plug

0
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Is the

0
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
Bank line of credit

0
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,319
The bank line of credit simply takes two

0
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Total assets

0
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,951
Extract from those total assets and liabilities that are not the bank

0
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
Bank line of credit note over here that i have interest interest is a function of the

0
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,751
Bank line of credit and the mortgage loan but if i calculate the interest based on the bank line of credit and then

0
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
Mortgage loan

0
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
I don't have circularity

0
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
Circularity is where the calculation

0
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,479
Requires the output of the calculation in order to be made

0
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
So here i get around that

0
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Bike

0
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Calculating interest

0
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
Based on balances

0
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,927
And assumed interest rates

0
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,231
And then i copy that number separately

0
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
5 children 2

0
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
Highlights

0
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Chevron outputs

0
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
From our

0
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Forecasting

0
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
Total financing

0
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
The sum of the bank line of credit and the mortgage loan

0
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
The line of credit

0
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,103
It seems that the mortgage loan is to

0
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
Totally available at law

0
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
Last year's level

0
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
And

0
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
The debt equity ratio

0
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
Which i took from the

0
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Forecasted

0
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Managerial balance sheet

0
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
I also included

0
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
A line of credit cover

0
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
This would be interesting

0
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
2/8

0
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
External supplier of

00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
The line of credit

0
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
And

0
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Typically

0
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
The amount of

0
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751

0
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
The amount of inventories and discounted by point

0
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
And compare that number

0
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
The outstanding

00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,183

You think is most appropriate

Gideon now it's just you

Forecasts are

00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Are critically dependent on

Capital one

0
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
Ideally we would have capital budgeting

Assets envy

0
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
We also need something with his
