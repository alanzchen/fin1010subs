Who will be the default goal

0
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,760
Wheel considered throughout this course

0
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320

0
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,848
Shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world

0
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,176
Chevrolet value is a result

0
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456

0
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256

Measures and analyzes value

0
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
This measurement and analysis of value

0
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
Is essential

0
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815

Should always be am i measuring the right thing and

0
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,015
Miami isn't the best way how closely do my assumptions and input data reflect reality

0
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,879
Our analysis is essential for the long-term health of the corporation

0
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
But our analysis is

0
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,975
Is not what we actually wish to a
