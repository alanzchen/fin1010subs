00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,840
I want to spend a few minutes today to talk about cash

0
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,912
You probably heard the expression cash is king

0
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,216
That's true in two senses

0
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,496
Claims

0
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,056
The definition of claims in finance

0
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,128
Are valued based on their expected cash flow

0
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
Complete

0
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,456
In times of difficulty

0
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,272
Company without sufficient cash balances made

0
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
Make face bankruptcy

0
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,856
A cash flow is

0
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,696
Is a cash payment into or out of company

0
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,792
Typically cash flows occur over a period of time

0
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,584
Icash stock

0
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,376
Your cash position

0
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,728
It's a balance of cash that is held in the bank accounts of a company

0
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,520
Icash stock

0
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,288
Is

0
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,640
The amount of cash available at an instant of

0
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Time

0
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
Cash stock

0
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
Is a use of financing

0
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
So clearly i'm just in

0
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,184
Introduce two concepts the first concept was a cash flow concept and the second was a catch

0
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,208
Stock

0
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,536
I introduce the managerial balance sheet one of the six

0
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
Part 2 the man you energy or balance sheet

0
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,472
Which cash we can think of a cash flow at a change in cash balances

0
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,032
From the beginning of the year which i'll call you

0
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Year 08

0
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
Time zero the balance

0
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
How cash at

0
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,920
At x 0 and that would change

0
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,016
To about the end of the year and i'll call that she won

0
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
For the change from c

0
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
02 c1

0
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
Is the cash flow

0
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
And clearly cash flow

0
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Comes

0
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,768
Hartley from operating income

0
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:42,144
The cash flow is not same as operating income cash flow is greater

0
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,472
Then operating income to the extent that we have

0
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
Positive depreciation

0
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Can amortize a shin

0
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
That reduce income relative to

0
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
Cash flow

0
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
Operating cash flow

0
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,528
It's all so different from operating in

0
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Income

0
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
To the extent that are

0
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Peebles

0
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,440
And are receivables at our inventories and

0
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,768
Can other parts of the working capital requirement change

0
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Clearly fr

0
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
Working capital

0
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Requirement increases

0
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,192
And it seems to do here shrimp to hear

0
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
Net increase

0
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
Must be financed

0
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
If the

0
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
The

0
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
Sources

0
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,152
How financing remain exactly the same

0
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Then

0
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
Get my feet

0
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Finance

0
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
By changes in cash balances

0
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
Cash flow from operations is

0
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
Is part of the

0
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
The overall change in

0
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Cash

0
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
Author

0
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Items

0
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
Change the cash balance

0
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
Maxwell

0
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
Among them are

0
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
Changes in the fixed assets

0
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
And the

0
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
Changes in financing we

0
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,824
We have to remember three kinds of financing short-term debt

0
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
Long-term debt equity

0
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
If short-term debt in

0
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,200
Increases

0
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,760
Danby have a positive cash flow if

0
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
Long-term debt

0
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
Decreases

0
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
Can we have a negative

0
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
Cash flow from the long-term depth

0
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
If paid in it

0
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
Equity

0
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,560
Decreases through an equity repurchase then we have

0
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Negative

0
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Cash flow

0
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
All of these together

0
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Account for the

0
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
The change

0
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
In cash
