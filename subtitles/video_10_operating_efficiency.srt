0
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,304
I'd like to conclude

0
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,192
This section on financial ratios are talking about operating efficiency ratios

0
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:14,848
By this time you realize there are many many racial to talk about the common size income statement and common size balance sheet

0
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
Cheats

0
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:22,016
Profitability ratios dupont analysis liquidity ratios leverage ratios and now we're talking about

0
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,320
Operating efficiency

0
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,160
Operating efficiency is primarily concerned

0
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
Turnover

0
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,232
How long a time at 2

0
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,256
Takes for a given

0
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024
Downset

0
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,304
Tv placed

0
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,352
Assets take up

0
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
Financing

0
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,656
Financing

0
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
Is expensive

0
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,008
So if we can reduce the assets

0
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
Weekend reviews

0
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
The financing

0
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
We're going to look

0
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,152
Components of

0
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,504
Of the worst capital requirement the major accounts of non-cash short

0
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
Short-term assets

0
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Accounts receivable

0
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
And inventories

0
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,416
Interested in analyzing

0
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,256
Speed at which accounts receivable and inventory turnover

0
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,864
Accounts payable is a free form of financing

0
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Are liabilities

0
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
Short-term debt

0
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984
Counter depth

0
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
Inequities

0
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,312
Are contributed by investors

0
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,872
Actually wish to invest in the firm

0
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
To make a prof

0
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,688
Accounts payable

0
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
Simply vera

0
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,760
About the wii

0
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,552
02 our suppliers

0
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,880
Our suppliers don't wish to invest in our firm butt

0
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,464
Suppliers are forced to invest in our firm

0
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
Judy

0
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Industry practice

0
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096
That allows us to pay later

0
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Ford

0
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,168
Supplies that we receive now

0
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
From this point of view

0
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,264
If account payable are truly free

0
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,056
It is in our interest

0
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
Maximize the accounts payable

0
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
In order to minimize the working capital

0
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,576
Set the ratios that were going to be looking at in operating efficiency concern

0
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
Inventories and accounts receivable have

0
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
As well as accounts pa

0
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,536
Santa pics inventory turnover is 11.

0
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
3/8

0
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,656
Times two that means if you take the cost of goods sold

0
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
Can you divide by the

0
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Average inventory

0
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Sorry

0
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
He'll come out with the number

0
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
11.38

0
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
We can express that in terms of days sales in inventory days sales inventory

0
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
Is simply

0
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,576
The reciprocal of the inventory turnover

0
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
X

0
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
365 days

0
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
On average it

0
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
It's

0
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Products

0
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,280
Are kept in inventory for 32 days

0
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
We can similarly calculator receivables turnover

0
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
Receivables turnover

0
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Is simply be

0
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
Sales

0
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
/

0
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Average

0
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Accounts receivable

0
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
Notice

0
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,920
That for receivables turnover

0
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
We use the

0
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Where can you be

0
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
Because accounts receivable

0
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
Are measured at the

0
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
Sales price in the accounting stay

0
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
Warehouse for inventories

0
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
We use the cost of goods sold because

0
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,560
Because inventories are recorded at the cost of goods sold

0
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
In the balance sheet

0
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Weekend express

0
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Receivables turn

0
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Turnover

0
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,240
10 days of sales receivable

0
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
Simile

0
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,336
We take the reciprocal

0
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
Of the receivables turnover and

0
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,944
10 x 365 begins

0
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
Pictures 365 days in the year

0
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,832
And that gives us the number of days that it takes for

0
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
For receivable to

0
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
I go through our

0
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Count sheet

0
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
On average

0
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,000
We hold receivables for 10 days

0
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
We can do the same calculation

0
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
Which respect to

0
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Pitbulls

0
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
That gives us then turn over

0
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
Of 11x

0
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Pitbulls

0
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,800
Turnover on average

0
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,592
11x per year

0
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,152
Days payable is simply the reciprocal

0
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
The payables turnover

0
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
X 3

0
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
365

0
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
Show on average

0
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,904
We take 31.36 days to make

0
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Make payment to

0
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
Watch pliers

0
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,791
We can look at the whole of net working capital

0
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,095
How to calculate a turnover for that

0
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,655
Notice that for

0
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Sanipac

0
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
This is a negative number

0
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
Why is it a negative number

0
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
You remember

0
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
From china pack

0
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
Does working capital requirement was negative

0
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
In fact for side effect

0
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
Get accounts payable

0
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039
Are greater than its accounts receivable plus

0
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Inventories

0
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
That means that sinopec get

0
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
Catnip

0
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Free financing

0
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
Its suppliers

0
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
Finally the calculator

0
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Asset turnover

0
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
This asset turnover

0
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Looks at total sales

0
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
/

0
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
Average assets

0
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
So this is the

0
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Assets the beginning of ear

0
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
Plasticity interior

0
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Divided by 2

0
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,687
To give us the number of times that

0
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
Assets are turned over

0
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Every year and 4 side effects

0
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
A turnover almost

0
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
Twice

0
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Prettier

0
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Hoffman laroche

0
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
How to much lower turnover

0
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
Agency that inventories

0
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
Turnover only

0
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
About twice a year

0
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,399
Whereas for side effect that turned over 11 times

0
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Receivables

0
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,263
Turn over only about five times per year

0
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Whereas for side effects

0
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
They turned over

0
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
35x

0
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
Now you might say well

0
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
That's because hoffman

0
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
The drug company

0
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
And sinopec

0
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Is a

0
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
Refiner of oil

0
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
Can you be right

0
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
What makes a lot of sense when

0
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
When you're looking at industry ratios

0
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
Compare like-with-like

0
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
Go into a company and

0
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,863
And comparative with other companies in the

0
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
The industry

0
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
We went to a website more

0
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Morningside

0
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Collected

0
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
Russian skater 4

0
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
Days sales outstanding

0
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
Inventory turnover

0
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Pitbulls.

0
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
Penn found out that on average when

0
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
When you compare

0
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
Roshe with the industry leader

0
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,879
Pfizer we found out the trash at higher turnover

0
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
And this

0
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
Days in inventory

0
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
When did pfizer

0
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,863
It had about the same days sales outstanding and it's

0
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
Pitbulls.

0
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
Where substantially less

0
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Danforth

0
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Fighter

0
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
It was able to get that free financing

0
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Dan pfeiffer

0
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
I've been using the word free

0
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
Refinancing rather too freely

0
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,991
And the reason why is it trade supplier

0
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,319
Often give a discount if they make payment earlier

0
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,183
For example of supply army office terms of 2/10

0
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Net

0
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,327
210 musette me get a 2% discount if

0
