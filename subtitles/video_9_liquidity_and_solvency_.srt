0
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,608
I'm going to continue my discussion of financial ratios

0
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,888
By looking at

0
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,168
Call fancy

0
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,448
And liquidity

0
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:13,056
The firm is liquid if it can meet its obligations when they come to you

0
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,592
Loss of equity

0
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,640
A firm is solvent

0
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,944
The value of assets

0
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,504
Exceed the value of a liabilities

0
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,832
In finance there are three major decisions

0
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,112
Mermaid body core

0
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
Corporate treasurer

0
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,440
The size of the couch cushion

0
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,024
The decision as to whether one to have long-term

0
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
Debt

0
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,328
What short-term debt

0
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,144
And the third decision is the capital structure decision

0
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,680
Ave

0
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
Equity

0
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,008
So this firm is liquid

0
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,080
Liquid because it's short-term debt

0
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
Is small

0
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,152
Relative to

0
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
It's cash equivalents

0
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,528
Gears are rough diagram of the managerial balance sheet

0
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,088
And if the short-term debt holders

0
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,624
Recall the debt

0
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,024
Obviously that dad at shortened equity paid out of cash and we're left with

0
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,304
A balance sheet

0
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
It still has a

0
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
A little bit of cash

0
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
Cash reserve

0
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
And

0
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
No short-term claimants

0
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
I can push the company

0
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
Indiana quality

0
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
However that same company

0
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,128
All the liquid

0
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,408
Yes actually

0
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
How do leveraged

0
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
It is at risk

0
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
Positivity

0
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
Because the assets

0
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,368
Could suffer a decline in value

0
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
And losses

0
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
To both

0
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
Yes holders

0
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
And equity holders

0
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
Credit that was an example of a

0
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Affirmed

0
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
Which liquid butt

0
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
It became insolvent

0
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
Here's a firm that is solvent but

0
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
What is a liquid

0
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,592
You can see that it has a large amount of short-term debt

0
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
Relative to its

0
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
More liquid assets

0
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:59,040
Cash and cash equivalents being very liquid they could be paid out without any loss

0
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
Weston capital requirement

0
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,440
Substantially liquid and fixed assets completely liquid

0
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,536
If there was a calling of the short-term debt

0
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,840
The debt holders demand for repayment

0
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
Would result in

0
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
Stress

0
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
The firm

0
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
Only the cash it available for payout

0
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
The firm with the unable to liquidate its work

0
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
Working capital requirement in fixed assets

0
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
At a fair value

0
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
And therefore it would suffer distress

0
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,296
Did the stress might even lead to it being petition the into bankruptcy

0
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,136
If the debtor appeared on able to pay payment

0
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,440
And the creditor observe demand

0
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
The creditor

0
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,536
And the debtors could propose plans for a settlement by

0
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
Pretty with a failure to agree on the plans

0
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Kermit

0
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
Pushed into bankruptcy and

0
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
Could be liquidated

0
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
So clearly

0
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Post solvency

0
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
And the quiddity are very important to the

0
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,176
Did the firm. some of the ratios we can use to measure liquidity

0
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
The cash ratio

0
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,856
The simplest is simply cash over current liabilities the current ratio current assets / current liabilities

0
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
And the quick ratio current assets minus

0
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Inventories

0
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
Out of current liabilities

0
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
These ratios are easy to calculate

0
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
Independence is our

0
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
Unambiguously

0
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,424
Placed on the balance sheet and they do give a

0
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Good indication of liquidity of a firm another liquidity indicator would be using the managerial balance sheet

0
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
And here we

0
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:32,736
We have a net stable funding ratio the shows the stable funds phone

0
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
Find the knot shop

0
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,088
Subject to withdrawal by the investor to

0
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,416
To have equity in long-term debt divided by the

0
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
The need for stable funds

0
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Fixed assets

0
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
Can working capital requirement

0
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
Are needed to be finance

0
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
From stable funds

0
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Sinopec

0
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
Show itself to be surprisingly

0
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Liquid

0
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Another quiddity

0
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Is decrease

0
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
Current assets

0
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
Far far left as current liabilities on

0
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Only about 17

0
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Going down to 60

0
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
In 2000

0
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
If you subtract the in

0
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
Inventories from the current assets

0
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,976
Before dividing them by current liabilities to get the quick crew race

0
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Show me

0
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
Pc assembly

0
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Decline

0
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
I am the numbers are very low

0
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Furniture

0
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
Terms that do not have guaranteed access to

0
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,543
Frequently they see a quick ratio of less than 1

0
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,127
As being problematic this is about one-quarter

0
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
The cash ratio is a miniscule at 2% so a withdrawal of 2% of the current liabilities

0
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:45,183
Take away the entire cash balance and only 82 - 87%

0
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
The needs

0
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
First eagle funding

0
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
Barnett

0
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
By actual stable funding

0
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
To the other

0
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
18%

0
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
At is finance

0
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
By unstable short-term fun

0
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,359
Treating to roche we see a completely different liquid he picture

0
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
The current ratio

0
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
There is between 1.35 and 1.74 all the all of liquidity ratios are dropping

0
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:16,927
They're still very comfortable the quick ratio is above one cash ranges for

0
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
From 1/2 to

0
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
The three quarters of current liabilities and more stable funding is available then

0
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
Can the need for stable funding

0
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,823
There's an excess of stable funding what can explain this difference between sign up

0
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Hack

0
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Roshe one reason

0
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:42,783
Might be the guaranteed availability of bank funding sinopec

0
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
Is a state on enterprise in china the state-owned banks are very comfortable with lending design a peck

0
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,999
Santa probably feels very comfortable in

0
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,559
Can drawing down bank line of credit when

0
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
Whenever it wishes to

0
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
So it doesn't need the cash balances

0
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,751
Roach doesn't have that kind of a position within the

0
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,591
Swiss economy moreover roche has a strategy of

0
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,199
Purchasing companies with promising intellectual property so

0
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,783
Maintaining a high cash balances and high liquidity

0
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
Can help

0
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Roshe

0
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Keep the powder dry for

0
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,951
For acquisitions turning now to leverage or so fancy

0
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
Capital structure

0
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
Involve step with short-term and long-term

0
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Debt

0
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
And equity

0
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
Buy the balance sheet identity

0
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
We know that acids are

0
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Are equal to 2

0
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Class act

0
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
From the balance sheet identity

0
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
You can see that

0
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Three measures of

0
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Capital structure

0
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,247
Are essentially identical the debt equity ratio is simply

0
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,551
Total debt divided by total equity

0
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
The declaration which

0
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
Which is simply debt over assets

0
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
Is simply 1-2

0
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
The reciprocal

0
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
Of the equity mall

0
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
The reciprocal of the

0
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Equity multiple

0
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Mississippi

0
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
Equity drive

0
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Divided by assets

0
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,751
1 - equity divided by assets is

0
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
The assets

0
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Minus equity divided

0
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Guided by assets

0
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
Simply dental

0
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
Over assets

0
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Is the debt ratio

0
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
As we noted for

0
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
4

0
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
Which is more

0
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
Leveraged

0
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Side effects

0
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
But it's

0
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
Debt ratio is

0
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Is dropping its

0
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Map from

0
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
72% of balance sheet

0
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
In 2011

0
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
2

0
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
