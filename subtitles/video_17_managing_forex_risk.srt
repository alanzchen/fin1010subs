00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,840
I'd like to continue with the discussion of foreign exchange

0
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,120
By talking about

0
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:05,888
Managing for

0
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:06,912
Foreign exchange expose

0
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,960
There are three types

0
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,728
F4

0
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,008
Foreign exchange exposure

0
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,080
Transactions expose

0
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
And operating exposure

0
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:18,944
Bossier

0
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,968
Is

0
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
The risk

0
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
The accounting perform

0
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
Company movie

0
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
Adversely affected

0
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,392
To the translation into the home currency

0
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,696
A foreign currency assets and liabilities

0
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
And

0
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
City consolidation

0
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
Can the home currency

0
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
Of foreign currency subsidiary accounts

0
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,656
Transaction exposure

0
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,704
Cash flow exposure

0
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
It's the risk that

0
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,544
Foreign currency-denominated cash flows

0
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,360
Translated into home current

0
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,128

0
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
Who be adversely affected

0
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,736
What were talking with transactions exposure

0
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,504
About

0
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528

0
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Cash flows

0
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,856
Cash flows that are typically occur

0
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
Within the

0
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
Humans

0
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
2 a year

0
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
Operating exposure is a much long

0
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
Longer-term concept

0
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,608
In fact it extends throughout the entire life of the come

0
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
It's the risk that the home

0
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Home currency

0
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Value

0
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,752
Of future expected cash flows

0
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,800
Will be adversely affected by unanticipated

0
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,592
Foreign exchange price changes

0
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
And it's expected cash flows

0
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Can you throw

0
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
Entire life of the company

0
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
Can contribute to

0
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,528
To the companies

0
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
Value

0
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
We're not going to talk about operating school

0
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
Bossier

0
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
Until i talk about it

0
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Net present value today

0
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,768
I'll just be talking about accounting exposure

0
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
Transactions expo

0
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,400
First of all accounting or translation expose

0
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,728
Translation exposure is the risk of losses

0
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
In the financial statements of a cup

0
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
Company when the assets and liabilities

0
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872

0
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
Are subject to adverse changes in

0
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Can exchange rate movements

0
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,736
Whether the company has

0
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,344
Citrus overseas or not it may have monetary assets and liabilities

0
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
If these monetary assets and live

0
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,208
Liabilities are denominated in foreign exchange

0
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,024
They will be translated at the spot rate

0
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
On the balance sheet date

0
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
And then the gains and losses

0
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
Associated with these changes

0
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,704
In the value of those

0
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
Monetary assets in life

0
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752

0
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776

0
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,600
All of the assets and liabilities of a foreign domiciled

00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,936

On the balance sheet date

0
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,872
If this process of consolidating

0
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,200
Foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries accounts

0
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
If the parent company

0
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,552
Cheats to foreign exchange gains or losses

0
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
East canton losses do not go through the proper

0
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
To something called the statement of comprehensive income

0
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,352
So let's look at the accounts of ge

0
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Ge has

0
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,216
Mini sub series located all over the world

0
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,776
And as you can see by this

0
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,592
Statement of comprehensive income

0
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
The translation or

0
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,248
Counting games can be considerable so this first line is the net earnings that

0
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
Cast from the profit and loss account

0
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600

0
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
But two of the adjustments

0
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
Are related to foreign exchange

0
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
And here we have

0
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
Currency translation adjustments

0
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,008
And here we have cash flow hedges

0
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
Peter hitches that

0
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,336
That were set up to offset

0
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872

00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Adjustments

0
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:05,248
And you can see the number 2.729 billion us dollars

00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
The word hedging

0
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Comes from

0
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
A protective barrier made of

Here's a picture of a hand around the house

The cash flows of the underlying risky transaction

00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
Betty hedges involved river doves

0
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
Such as forwards swaps and options

0
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
The hedges can also be

0
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
Balance sheet hedges

0
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
Which is the one that might exist

Mini hedges used to riverton

0
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,231
And because these derivatives

00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
Trade in highly liquid markets

00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,839

The bid-ask spread

00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,239
Around the expected value of that derivative

Pictures of foreign exchange for

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,031
Corporate treasurers may wish to hatch because

0
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,895
Predictions that they have a foreign exchange rate changes are poor

0
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,943
You can often get it wrong

0
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Hitching

0
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,015
Can increase the value of the firm

0
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
Simply be

0
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
Reducing the volatility of cash flows

0
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,671
That makes the firm less risky to investors

0
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
Can hitting with forwards and swap

0
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
Kent to be as i said relatively cheap

0
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,119
The corporate treasurers can also wish to speculate

0
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
They may wish to speculate

0
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,983
They're good at predicting the future

0
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
And if the corporate treasurer

0
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,127
Nearest living or is not too risk-averse

0
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
Corporate treasurers want to add value

0
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
Most company strength is not

0
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Hot finance

0
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,343
And they should not be encouraged play in the markets get their two companies have

0
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,695
Have corporate treasurers that do have expertise in financial markets

0
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,279
And in order to motivate the high-quality individuals then

0
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,351
Baby given discretion to take financial risks for

0
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Foreign expected return

0
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,287
For example they may wish to take open positions on foreign exchange for coverage is expensive

0
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
And prefers red

0
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
Relative to forecasts

0
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,455
Or they may wish to make long-term bets on exchange rate movements

0
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
Based on macroeconomic analysis

0
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,087
Here is a simple example of hedging a transaction

0
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,463
The treasurer of a us-based multinational corporation in you expect that you're going to be cu

0
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
Japanese yen

0
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
10 billion in flow in one year

0
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,887
The contracted as a contractor japanese yen in flow

0
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
Your home currency is us dollars

0
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
You have no opinion on

0
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
On what the expected future spot will be

0
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
But the spot rate is .83

0
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
333 us dollars 400 japanese yen and

0
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
And the forward rate

0
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,551
East point 8706 us dollars

0
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
For japanese yen

0
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
If your direct quote on the japanese yen

0
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
10 lies the problem

0
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Correctly

0
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
You should quantify the risk here

0
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Here's the japanese yen

0
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
Are u.s. dollar pound

0
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
From 2010

0
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
2 - 2015

0
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
And you can see that it is

0
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Activated quiet

0
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,103
Michael are going down to almost 75 yen per us dollar

0
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Up to

0
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
225 yen are you

0
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
U.s. dollar

0
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
Show clearly there is risk with industry

0
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
Transaction how do we measure the risk

0
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,623
We can use simple statistical techniques to do so

0
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
Calculate the standard deviation of returns

0
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
How the exchange rate

0
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
Again here is the

0
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
How to japanese yen per us dollar from

0
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
2010 -

0
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
The

0
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Here is where

0
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Where that path came from

0
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
This is the direct quote

0
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
From the japanese perspective

0
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
Find the price of us dollars

0
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
And these are the dates

0
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
Starting from the

0
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
10th of september 2015

0
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
And working back

0
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
2

0
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
A 2000

0
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
Here are the calculations app

0
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,767
The top me have the daily standard deviation

0
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
Which is simply the

0
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
Sample standard deviation of this vector

0
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
And here is so that is

0
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
.39% per day

0
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
Adhere is the annual standard deviation

0
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
We just take the daily standard deviation

0
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
And

0
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
X 2

0
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
250 that's enough

0
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
Number of trading days in the year

0
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
The power

0
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
1/2

0
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Note that over the period

0
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Ivy

0
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
Cnn appreciated

Sew weave

0
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
How to find the risk

0
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,167
Hi by saying that the i'm going to assume that there's no excuse

0
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
That's what the corporate treasurer believes

0
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
And all simply plug the

0
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Standard deviation

0
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
Is the annual standard deviation

0
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:37,503
Into a normal distribution x 1.65 standard deviations

0
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
And that gives this

0
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
10%

0
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Best to say that

0
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,135
Have to say is 95%

0
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
Probability

0
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
That we will not lose more

0
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
Then 10%. 10% of the principal amount is not trivial by booking the forward we would sell

0
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
Japanese yen

0
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,239
10 billion forward in one year with liver the japanese yen 10

0
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
An except

0
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Us dollars

0
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
87.06 million

0
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
The advantages of the forward hedge

0
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Is it tuesday cheap intern

0
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,039
The transaction costs and the forward pricing and to reflect

0
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
Forecast

0
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
This is the conclusion from the last lecture

0
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,487
Did the forward price is an unbiased predictor of the future spot clean

0
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Clearly

0
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
If the forward trades at

0
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
At a premium

0
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,143
But we expect no change in the future spot it

0
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
It much better to hatch

0
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
In this case

0
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Forward

0
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
What's trading at a premium

0
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Let it say we received

0
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
Higher valuation for the
